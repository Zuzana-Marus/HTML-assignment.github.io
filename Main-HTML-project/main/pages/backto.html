      <p><strong> Balm for you mind, body and soul.</strong>
        Yoga means ‘union’ or ‘connection’.<br>
        In Sanskrit, the word ‘yoga’ is used to signify any 
        form of connection. Yoga is both a state of 
        connection and a body of techniques that allow us 
        to connect to anything.<br>
        Conscious connection to something allows us to feel 
        and experience that thing, person, or experience.<br>
        The experience of connection is a state of yoga, a joyful 
        and blissful, fulfilling experience.
