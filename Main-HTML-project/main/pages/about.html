        <p> A Yoga Asana or yoga pose is a body posture 
          that is performed to benefit both body and mind. <br> 
          The concept of Yoga is not something new in our culture, 
          our ancestors are performing it for ages.<br> 
          And now more people start to realize its importance and start doing it. 
          Studies have found that yoga asanas can help one in weight loss, <br>
          get more flexibility, shoot up the health of the heart and digestion and many more.
